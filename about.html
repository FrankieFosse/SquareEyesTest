            Our Story
            Square Eyes was born out of a deep passion for the silver screen. As avid movie lovers 
            ourselves, we realized the need for a platform that not only provides access to a vast 
            library of films but also fosters a community of like-minded individuals who appreciate 
            the art of filmmaking. Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a space 
            where movie aficionados could come together, explore, and share their cinematic adventures. 
            Today, Square Eyes stands as a testament to that vision, connecting people from all walks 
            of life through the universal language of film.
